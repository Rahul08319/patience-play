Original prompt: Add all applicable YouTube Playables SDK requirements to https://github.com/Rahul08319/patience-play.git, without monetization requirements; suggest additional features.

2026-09-10
- Added the YouTube Playables SDK before the game bundle in `index.html`.
- Added a safe SDK adapter for readiness callbacks, Playables/local persistence, YouTube locale, audio changes, pause/resume, health logging, and best-score reporting. Ads APIs are intentionally not used.
- The adapter has unit coverage for local fallback plus the SDK lifecycle, cloud-save, language, audio, pause/resume subscription, and score paths.
- The prescribed Playwright game client could not run because Playwright is not a project dependency; no new dependency was added solely for validation.
- Suggested next work: localization strings, daily challenge seed, and accessibility preferences.

2026-09-10
- Implemented a daily seeded challenge: every UTC day has the same round, fake-out, and power-up sequence, plus a persistent daily top-10 board.
- Added SDK-locale UI copy and localized gameplay prompts/tutorials for English, Spanish, and Hindi.
- Added reduced motion, high contrast, and accessible distinct sound-cue options; these persist in the Playables save.
- Verified with Vitest (3 passing tests) and a successful production Vite build.

2026-09-12
- Added viewport-safe controls, keyboard/fullscreen support, text-state output for automation, and pause cleanup for score/progression timers.
- Added a visible Daily Challenge briefing card and a controls hint to the menu.
- Fixed Playables pause/resume lifecycle so an interrupted round restarts only after `onResume`, never while the game is still paused.

2026-09-23
- Added a dependency-free WebGL aurora renderer: it adapts its color to game phase, caps rendering resolution for mobile performance, pauses when hidden, and renders one static frame with Reduced Motion enabled.
- Updated the main menu with a glass-and-depth visual treatment and a tactile primary action.
- The curated skill catalog has no Apple-design skill to install; the visual approach follows Apple-inspired design principles directly instead.
- Final production build completed successfully after the responsiveness/pause polish.

2026-09-27
- User clarified this repository is a game, so the root app now mounts `TapOrWaitGame` directly without site routing or generic toast/query wrappers.
- Replaced leftover Lovable website preview metadata with game-specific title and sharing text.
- Production build succeeds (35 modules; 187.36 kB JavaScript before gzip). Vitest passes all 7 tests.
- The prescribed Playwright game client remains unavailable because its `playwright` package is not installed in this workspace; no dependency was added solely for this root-shell cleanup.
